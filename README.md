EVA was developed with the intention of helping departments of companies or universities that are very far apart, thus facilitating the sharing of student or employee data between those departments with record speed in data synchronization.

We have the UAN university in Angola ![🇦🇴](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tc5/1/16/1f1e6_1f1f4.png), it has several departments. Being one in Camama, which is the headquarters of the university, and another department around the Martyrs or International Airport, this way if a university employee requests the data of a student who was transferred from the University Campus to these departments, through a click or by typing the name of the student, all the data linked to the student will be shown. And if on Campus another employee edits the student's data, in seconds these changes will be shown to the department located in Mártires.
